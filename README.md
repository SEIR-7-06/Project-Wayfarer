## Brief

We have been commissioned to build a travel community, code-named **Project Wayfarer** for now, for users to share tips (AKA posts) about their favorite locations around the world.

## Client Contract

The client has provided basic wireframes and user stories.

* [Wireframes](./wireframes.png)
* [User Stories](./user-stories.md)

## Process

The client contract consists of three core sprints and four bonus sprints. Each sprint contains a set of user stories. You may not complete all of the sprints within the time period, and that's ok. **The goal is to gain experience working on a development project in a group while navigating a client's feature list.**

You will work in groups of 4-5, and we expect you to **pair program** and/or **mob program** (group of 3 or more) for the majority of the time you're writing code.

During morning scrums and in smaller check-ins throughout the day, clearly communicate your current status and next steps to your teammates. Use a kanban-style scrum board such as **Trello** to organize tasks ([example Trello board](https://trello.com/b/JPdt327u/vagabond)).

Commit changes at least once for each user story. Put effort into your **design**.

Work as **[git collaborators](./git-collaboration-workflow.md), build on feature branches, and submit pull requests for approval and merging**.

Use this as an opportunity to write clean code.
* Indentation
* Readability/clarity
* Naming
* Organization
* Commenting
* DRYness

## Questions to Ask Yourselves

1. **Are you all clear about what the client wants?** Identify vague areas. Seek clarification in any cases where you feel less confident about your interpretation of the client's vision.

2. **What will the UX/UI flow be?** Hammer out any areas of ambiguity in the wireframes

3. **Which models do you need to implement?** Create an ERD for the client to reference.

4. **What are the major milestones or components that you need to complete?** How can these be turned into tasks that group members can complete in pairs? Where do these milestones overlap and how will those related tasks be managed?

5. **What milestones are you and your group members interested in working on?** How can you effectively delegate the work into pairs so that each group member is interested, challenged, and productive?

## Presentation

Project presentations will be on on **02/26/2021 Friday**.

Each group will have 10 minutes to present and should feature all members of the team.

**Your presentation should include:**

* Tour (demo) of your app
* Challenges and Triumphs you encountered along the way
* How did your group approach the requirements? (mention anything unique or creative your group chose to do)
* What was easier than you thought? What was more challenging?
* Words of wisdom - What advice would you give to a brand new group taking on this project
* Shout outs for fellow students!

## Evaluation

You will be evaluated on the following measures:

1. Project workflow
  - frequent commits with good commit messages
  - cooperative group work including majority of pair programing
  - effective use of branches
  - planning to avoid excessive merge conflicts
  - deliberate approach - routeside-in, logical progress from skateboard to car
  - the code is your original code
2. Readability
  - to what degree does your app fulfill the user stories?
  - code is clean
  - follows good naming conventions
  - code is free of obvious errors and bugs
  - code demonstrates good problem solving
  - code is DRY
3. Technical requirements
  - all core requirements from sprints 1
